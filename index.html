    <!-- DATA SECTION -->
    <div class="text-div">
      <p>In San Francisco, 18 percent of residents are planning to move in the next year, 
        more than almost any other major metropolitan area in the country, according to the 
        2021 American Housing Survey.
      </p>

      <h2>“San Francisco, at least in my experience, is a very transient city. There are people coming and going all the time” said Kevin Hou. </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>Kevin Hou, a 22-year-old who moved to the city in 2022. Hou, a recent resident of the Mid-Market neighborhood in San Francisco, notes how the transitory social culture of San Francisco makes it more difficult for young adults who are new to the city to form meaningful relationships. “Generally people here are willing to make friends, but you always run into that situation where someone is leaving soon.” 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p> Christopher Yin, who moved to San Francisco to work in tech, describes a sense of urgency around making new friends. This, combined with a work-centered social culture can give socializing a “transactional feel,” Yin said, “like, ‘what can you do for me?’ or ‘I only want to meet people who fit this goal of mine.’”
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>“I think my initial experience [moving to San Francisco] was one of friend-making-mania. I felt like to be truly settled in, I had to have a solid group of friends,” said Hou. 
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p id="logos-intro">The urgent desire for people in their 20s to make friends quickly is 
        what allows social clubs, newsletters and apps to thrive.

      <h2>Current solutions</h2>
    </div>

    <!-- GROUND FLOOR -->
      
    <div class="container">

      <img class="card" src="GFC Front.png">

      <div class="text-div">
        <p>Ground Floor Club is a social club in San Francisco that “fosters connections for people to meet others that share the same interests” through social events, weekly club meetings and a physical coworking space.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-div">
        <p>“One of our biggest demographics is between around 28 to 38,” said Dakota Seidenspinner, the marketing manager of Ground Floor Club. “It’s a lot of people that are post-grad. They're moving out of the city that they graduated in, they're moving away from their college friends, and they want to experience a new city, but they don't know how or where to meet people.”  
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="text-div">
        <p>“We had originally wanted to cap membership at 250,” Seidenspinner said. The demand for membership was so high the Ground Floor Club ultimately decided to cap their membership at 500.
        </p>
      </div>
      
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">

      <p>After an initial meeting, it can be difficult for new residents to find things to do with their potential friends. Yin described “stalking Google Maps” in order to find things to do. “I would zoom in on the area where I live,” said Yin, “marking or pinning places near me that seem vaguely interesting.”

      <div class="text-div">
        <p><a href="https://brokeassstuart.com/">Broke A*s Stuart</a> is “The Bay Area’s Favorite 
          Newsletter” for finding social events, according to its site. Over 40,000 people are currently 
          subscribed to receive weekly information about events, concerts and social gatherings happening in 
          San Francisco that might otherwise be hard to find.

    <!-- EDDIE'S LIST -->

    <div class="container">   

      <img class="card" src="Eddie Front.png">

      <div class="text-div">
        <p>Eddie Hernandez created another popular social newsletter, Eddie’s List, in July of 2022. “Even people who want to go out don’t want to check out events and log information,” he said. “It's hard to find, it’s hard to access, it's like, ‘is this worth checking out?’ There's a lot of uncertainty. But if there's a sense that other people might go, and there is somebody who is actually vettings these events, it makes it easier to go.”
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <!-- OTHER SOCIAL APPS -->

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>Yin described using social information sites and apps, in his case Meetup.com, to find activities to 
        do in person with other San Francisco residents. He and a friend attend a corgi owner meetup every 
        Friday in a city park where they can pet the dogs and talk to other owners. “The social app thing works,” 
        he said. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="sub-header">
      <h2>How about social apps?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>Bumble BFF and Nudge are two other apps commonly used to meet people in new areas. Some use them to 
        meet others online and maintain entirely digital friendships, while others use them to facilitate 
        initial connections online before meeting in person.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>“I tried the apps for a little bit; there's some efficacy there,” said Joey Santoro, who graduated 
        from college in 2019 before moving to San Francisco the same year. “Although I don't think I want it. 
        I want to be the kind of person who can meet somebody in public through a shared hobby or through a 
        friend rather than through an app,” said Santoro, 24.  
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>Ren-Chan likes friend making apps because,”you get a ton of options, it is a really wide net that 
        you get to cast.” However, he said that he dislikes them because they result in less successful 
        friendships than organic interaction. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>“So it's more efficient, I guess, in that you're running through more people faster, but also not 
        more efficient because the odds of making real friends are lower,” said Ren-Chan.
      </h2>
    </div>

    <!-- BRANCH COMES IN -->
    <div id="sub-header">
      <h2>Beyond the solutions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>While social facilitators such as apps, newsletters and social clubs help people initially find 
        events and meet others, Hernandez also believes real success depends on the user’s mindset. They 
        have to change their perspective, “rather than just rely on a tool, because the tool is just 
        basically the first step,” Hernandez said. “It is not going to fix anything if you don't kind of 
        have all the reinforcing efforts and prioritization that is needed to get the most out of those.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>Both when using social facilitators and when meeting people offline, Chen-Ran and Hou describe the 
        importance of patience and dedication in allowing a natural friendship to form. 
      </p>

      <h2>The importance of patience</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>In early 2022, Chen-Ran stumbled into the <a href="https://www.cityartgallery.org/">City Art Gallery</a>
        in the Mission District. Intrigued by the artwork, he began to speak to the person at the front desk — who 
        turned out to be the artist. Immediately, they hit it off, and made plans to paint outdoors together the 
        following week. After their first artistic pursuit, they dedicated themselves to painting outdoors every week.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>“I think repetition is a huge part of making friends,” Hou said. “ It's kind of emulating that same environment 
        that classes had, where it was set time, set schedule, set place, and then you're all just kind of congregated in 
        this place experiencing a very similar thing. Repetition could include the gym, an art class, or anything like that.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>Chen-Ran said that it was not until the third time painting together that they realized they were friends. After 
        that, they started hanging out in other contexts.  She recently attended his 25th birthday party.

    </div>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>“It took nearly a year to find ‘my people’,” said Chen-Ran.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text-div">
      <p>“Something I wish I realized when I first moved here is that making real friends is a slow process,” Hou said. “It's 
        okay to have moved to a new city and not have any friends for a little bit. Be patient and enjoy the moment."

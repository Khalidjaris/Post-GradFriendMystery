    <h1>Making Friends after College</h1>
    <!-- Names? -->

    <h2 class="pull-quote">“Making friends as a post-grad: the great unsolved mystery.”</h2>
    <p>Emmet Chen-Ran moved to San Francisco in 2021 after graduating from Yale university. 
      Now 25 years old, he ____.
    </p>

    <!-- DATA SECTION -->
    <p>In San Francisco, 18 percent of residents are planning to move in the next year, 
      more than almost any other major metropolitan area in the country, according to the 
      2021 American Housing Survey.
    </p>

    <p>Hou, a recent resident of the Mid-Market neighborhood in San Francisco, 
      notes how the transitory social culture of San Francisco makes it more difficult 
      for young adults who are new to the city to form meaningful relationships. 
      “Generally people here are willing to make friends, but you always run into that 
      situation where someone is leaving soon.
    </p>
    <p>Christopher Yin, who moved to San Francisco to work in tech, describes a 
      sense of urgency around making new friends. This, combined with a work-centered 
      social culture can give socializing a “transactional feel,” Yin said, “like, 
      ‘what can you do for me?’ or ‘I only want to meet people who fit this goal of mine.’”
    </p>

    <h2 class="pull-quote">“I think my initial experience [moving to San Francisco] was one of 
      friend-making-mania. I felt like to be truly settled in, I had to have a solid group of 
      friends,” said Hou.

    <!-- GROUND FLOOR -->

    <div id="container">

      <p id="logos-intro">The urgent desire for people in their 20s to make friends quickly is 
        what allows social clubs, newsletters and apps to thrive.
      </p>

      <p class="ground-floor">Ground Floor Club is a social club in San Francisco that “fosters 
        connections for people to meet others that share the same interests” through social events, 
        weekly club meetings and a physical coworking space.
      </p>
      <p class="ground-floor">“One of our biggest demographics is between around 28 to 38,” said 
        Dakota Seidenspinner, the marketing manager of Ground Floor Club. “It’s a lot of people 
        that are post-grad. They're moving out of the city that they graduated in, they're moving 
        away from their college friends, and they want to experience a new city, but they don't know 
        how or where to meet people.”
      </p>
      <p class="ground-floor">“We had originally wanted to cap membership at 250,” Seidenspinner said. 
        The demand for membership was so high the Ground Floor Club ultimately decided to cap their 
        membership at 500.

    <!-- BROKE-ASS STUART -->

    <div id="container">     
      <img id="stuart-card" src="Stuart Front.png">
      <p>After an initial meeting, it can be difficult for new residents to find things 
        to do with their potential friends. Yin described “stalking Google Maps” in order to find things 
        to do. “I would zoom in on the area where I live,” said Yin, “marking or pinning places near me 
        that seem vaguely interesting.” 
      </p>
  </div>

    <p id="news-letters">Enter, social event newsletters.</p>

    <p class="stuart"><a href="https://brokeassstuart.com/">Broke A*s Stuart</a>is “The Bay Area’s Favorite 
      Newsletter” for finding social events, according to its site. Over 40,000 people are currently 
      subscribed to receive weekly information about events, concerts and social gatherings happening in 
      San Francisco that might otherwise be hard to find. 
    </p>

    <!-- EDDIE'S LIST -->

    <div id="container">     
      <img id="eddie-card" src="Eddie Front.png">
      <p class="eddie">Eddie Hernandez created another popular social newsletter, Eddie’s List, in July of 
        2022. “Even people who want to go out don’t want to check out events and log information,” he said. 
        “It's hard to find, it’s hard to access, it's like, ‘is this worth checking out?’ There's a lot of 
        uncertainty. But if there's a sense that other people might go, and there is somebody who is actually 
        vettings these events, it makes it easier to go.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- OTHER SOCIAL APPS -->

    <p>Yin described using social information sites and apps, in his case Meetup.com, to find activities to 
      do in person with other San Francisco residents. He and a friend attend a corgi owner meetup every 
      Friday in a city park where they can pet the dogs and talk to other owners. “The social app thing works,” 
      he said. 
    </p>

    <p>Bumble BFF and Nudge are two other apps commonly used to meet people in new areas. Some use them to 
      meet others online and maintain entirely digital friendships, while others use them to facilitate 
      initial connections online before meeting in person.
    </p>

    <p>“I tried the apps for a little bit; there's some efficacy there,” said Joey Santoro, who graduated 
      from college in 2019 before moving to San Francisco the same year. “Although I don't think I want it. 
      I want to be the kind of person who can meet somebody in public through a shared hobby or through a 
      friend rather than through an app,” said Santoro, 24.  
    </p>

    <p>Ren-Chan likes friend making apps because,”you get a ton of options, it is a really wide net that 
      you get to cast.” However, he said that he dislikes them because they result in less successful 
      friendships than organic interaction. 
    </p>

    <p>“So it's more efficient, I guess, in that you're running through more people faster, but also not 
      more efficient because the odds of making real friends are lower,” said Ren-Chan.
    </p>

    <!-- BRANCH COMES IN -->
    
    <p>While social facilitators such as apps, newsletters and social clubs help people initially find 
      events and meet others, Hernandez also believes real success depends on the user’s mindset. They 
      have to change their perspective, “rather than just rely on a tool, because the tool is just 
      basically the first step,” Hernandez said. “It is not going to fix anything if you don't kind of 
      have all the reinforcing efforts and prioritization that is needed to get the most out of those.”
    </p>
    <p>Both when using social facilitators and when meeting people offline, Chen-Ran and Hou describe the 
      importance of patience and dedication in allowing a natural friendship to form. 
    </p>
    <p>In early 2022, Chen-Ran stumbled into the <a href="https://www.cityartgallery.org/">City Art Gallery</a>
      in the Mission District. Intrigued by the artwork, he began to speak to the person at the front desk — who 
      turned out to be the artist. Immediately, they hit it off, and made plans to paint outdoors together the 
      following week. After their first artistic pursuit, they dedicated themselves to painting outdoors every week.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->

    <p>“I think repetition is a huge part of making friends,” Hou said. “ It's kind of emulating that same environment 
      that classes had, where it was set time, set schedule, set place, and then you're all just kind of congregated in 
      this place experiencing a very similar thing. Repetition could include the gym, an art class, or anything like that.”
    </p>
    <p>Chen-Ran said that it was not until the third time painting together that they realized they were friends. After 
      that, they started hanging out in other contexts.  She recently attended his 25th birthday party. 
    </p>

    <p class="pull-quote">“It took nearly a year to find ‘my people’,” said Chen-Ran.</p>

    <p>“Something I wish I realized when I first moved here is that making real friends is a slow process,” Hou said. “It's 
      okay to have moved to a new city and not have any friends for a little bit,. Be patient and enjoy the moment."
